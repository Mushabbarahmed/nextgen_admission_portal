##Project Setup Guide
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

# Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

## 1. Clone the Repository



```bash

First, clone the repository from GitHub:
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
2. Unzip the Project Files (if applicable)
If you downloaded the ZIP file from GitHub, unzip it:
bashCopyunzip ai_nextgen-main.zip
Replace ai_nextgen-main.zip with the name of your ZIP file.
3. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory:
bashCopycd ai_nextgen
4. Create a New React Project (if needed)
If the node_modules directory is missing or you prefer starting fresh, create a new React app (optional, if necessary):
bashCopynpx create-react-app ai_nextgen
Then, move the existing project files into this new React app folder.
5. Install Project Dependencies
Since the node_modules directory is not included in the repository, install all the required dependencies by running:
bashCopynpm install
This will install all dependencies listed in the package.json file.
6. Required Packages
The following dependencies will be installed:

@google-cloud/vertexai: ^1.4.0
@testing-library/jest-dom: ^5.17.0
@testing-library/react: ^13.4.0
@testing-library/user-event: ^13.5.0
axios: ^1.7.2
bcryptjs: ^2.4.3
bootstrap: ^5.3.3
concurrently: ^8.2.2
gridfs-stream: ^1.1.1
js-cookie: ^3.0.5
jsonwebtoken: ^9.0.2
mongoose: ^8.4.4
multer: ^1.4.5-lts.1
multer-gridfs-storage: ^5.0.2
react: ^18.3.1
react-dom: ^18.3.1
react-icons: ^5.2.1
react-router-dom: ^6.24.0
react-scripts: 5.0.1
recharts: ^2.12.7
web-vitals: ^2.1.4
xlsx: ^0.18.5

7. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, start the React app using:
bashCopynpm start
If the project includes a backend, run it concurrently using:
bashCopynpm run both
8. Build the Project (Optional)
To create a production build, run:
bashCopynpm run build
This will create a build/ directory with the optimized production files.
9. Environment Variables (if applicable)
Ensure that you have all necessary environment variables set up in a .env file in the root directory. Check the code or documentation for the required variables.
10. Additional Notes

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your machine.
If any dependencies are missing, install them manually using npm install <package-name>.
